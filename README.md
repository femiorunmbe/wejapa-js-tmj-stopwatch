# A Stopwatch JavaScript App with Lap Functionality
**_Project: J5_**

## (c)Team Javascript-J WeJapa Internship V1.0

This was created without any framework using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Icons from Fontawesome were used to identify the buttons.

## Here is how the app works:
- Stopwatch has 4 arms: Milliseconds, seconds, minutes and hour
- First Button (Play) : The timer starts when the first button is clicked
- Second button (Pause): This button pauses the timer
- Third button (Reset): By clicking this button, the timer is reset to zero as well as any lap records cleared
- Fourth button (Lap): Each time this button is clicked, a screenshot of that particular time is recorded.
